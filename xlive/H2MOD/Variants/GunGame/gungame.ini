## GunGame.ini
## The following file is used for the H2V:Online GunGame mode
## Currently this only works on the client not dedicated servers, and you must be host.
## In order to turn this on set gungame = 1 inside of the xlive.ini
##

## The following is where you can choose what weapons players get per level,
## The only weapons you cannot decide yet are the levels 17 and 18 which are the grenade levels.
##
## Support for this will be added in the future.
## In this version of gungame once a player reaches level 18 (Plasma grenade) after getting a kill they should be reset to 0
## In the future I would like to expand this further then that and spawn them with weapons + Grenades or such.
